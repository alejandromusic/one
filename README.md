This is an interactive map that shows the user where his/her current position
and the position of any building or department on the college campus.

This is a web application was built using:
- jQuery Mobile for the looks and navigation
- Javascript (geolocation) to find the coordinates
- Google Maps API
- AJAX to dynamically fetch news from the college website and facebook page

Known bugs
- My position may be inaccurate the first time is called
- Changing from landscape to portrait in an Apple device may cause issues (native bug from jQuery Mobile)
- Transitions may not work on certain Android versions (jQuery Mobile native bug)
